    <p>A bundle of organic beets from a local farm co-op program.</p>
    <p>55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the food.</p>
    <p>The usually deep purple roots of <strong>beetroot</strong> are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable.</p>
    <p>In fact, Jim Halpert once said this about beets,<q>"Fact, bears eat beets. Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica"</q>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I have some weird habits. For instance, I love beets. Show me a salad bar and I will clean them out of their beets"</q>
